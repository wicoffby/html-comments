    <p>How can sprinkiling comments in your code actually help you become a better code? It can help you remember important things about your code like what the code does or when the code was made</p>

    <p>What symbols mark the beggining and end of an HTML comment? A comment starts with &lt;!&hyphen; &hyphen; and ends with &hyphen; &hyphen; &gt; </p> 
    
    <p>Two guidlines for writing comments: Make comments meaningful, and good comments do not excuse unlear code.</p>
